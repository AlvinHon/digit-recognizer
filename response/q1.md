To modify the provided code to use CUDA for training the model, follow these steps:

1. Check if CUDA is available and set the device accordingly.
2. Move the model to the chosen device.
3. Ensure that the data (inputs and labels) are also moved to the device during training.

Here's how you can update the code:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Check if CUDA is available, otherwise use CPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

train_csv = pd.read_csv('./data/train.csv')
test_csv = pd.read_csv('./data/test.csv')

print(train_csv['label'])

# Create NN model for the dataset of digit recognition
class Net(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, 256)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.fc3 = torch.nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc4 = torch.nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = self.fc4(x)
        return x

model = Net()
model.to(device)  # Move the model to the chosen device (CUDA or CPU)
print(model)

# Training the model with train_csv
# Note: Ensure that during training, your data (inputs and labels) are also moved to the device.
# Example: inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
model.train()
```


Remember, when you start training the model, you'll need to ensure that both the input data and the labels are moved to the same device as the model before you pass them to the model for forward and backward passes. This is hinted at in the comment at the end of the code snippet.
