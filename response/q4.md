Given the structure of `train_csv` and `test_csv`, and the error you encountered, it's clear that the input to the model needs to be adjusted to match the expected dimensions. The model expects inputs of size 784 (the number of features), but the first column of `train_csv` is the label, not a feature. Therefore, you need to exclude the first column when passing data to the model. Here's how you can adjust your training loop to fix the issue:

1. **Extract Features and Labels**: For `train_csv`, separate the labels (first column) from the features (remaining 784 columns).
2. **Reshape Input**: Ensure the input tensor is correctly shaped to match the model's expected input size of 784.
3. **Convert to Tensor and Send to Device**: Convert the features and labels to tensors, reshape them as needed, and send them to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).

Here's an example of how you might implement a training loop step with these adjustments:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Assuming the rest of your code from app.py is above this

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example training loop for one epoch
for i in range(len(train_csv)):
    # Separate features and label
    x = train_csv.iloc[i, 1:].values.astype(np.float32)  # Features (all columns except the first)
    y = train_csv.iloc[i, 0]  # Label (first column)
    
    # Convert to tensors
    x_tensor = torch.tensor(x, device=device).view(-1, 784)  # Reshape x to [1, 784]
    y_tensor = torch.tensor(y, device=device, dtype=torch.long).view(-1)  # Make sure y is a long tensor
    
    # Zero the parameter gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Forward + backward + optimize
    outputs = model(x_tensor)
    loss_val = loss(outputs, y_tensor)
    loss_val.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print('Finished Training')
```

This code snippet assumes you're running a very basic training loop for demonstration purposes. In practice, you'd likely want to batch your data rather than passing it one row at a time, use validation sets, and include more sophisticated training logic (like epoch handling and performance monitoring).
