The error indicates that the model and the data are not on the same device, causing a mismatch when performing operations. To fix this, ensure that both the model and the data (inputs x and labels y) are moved to the same device (either CPU or CUDA) before performing operations on them. Here's how you can fix the code:

```python
for epoch in range(10):
    for i in range(len(train_csv)):
        # Convert the data to tensors and move them to the same device as the model
        x = torch.tensor(train_csv.iloc[i, 1:].values, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
        y = torch.tensor(train_csv.iloc[i, 0], dtype=torch.long).to(device)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        y_pred = model(x.view(1, -1))  # Ensure x is the correct shape for the model
        loss_val = loss(y_pred, y.view(-1))
        loss_val.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

Key changes and considerations:

- `.to(device)` is added to both `x` and `y` tensors to ensure they are moved to the same device as the model before computation.
- `x.view(1, -1)` is used to ensure `x` is in the correct shape for the model. This is necessary because the model expects a batch dimension, and each `x` is a single example.
- The `y.view(-1)` is used to ensure `y` is in the correct shape expected by the loss function. This might not be strictly necessary depending on the shape of `y`, but it's a good practice to ensure compatibility with the loss function's expectations.
