To modify the model to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the digit recognition dataset, we need to adjust the architecture to include convolutional layers. CNNs are more suitable for image data as they can capture spatial hierarchies in the images through the use of filters. Given the input images are 28x28 pixels, we'll start with two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers. The input to the first convolutional layer should be reshaped to reflect the image dimensions (1x28x28) since it's a single-channel (grayscale) image.

Here's how you can modify the `Net` class to implement a simple CNN:

```python
class CNNNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNNNet, self).__init__()
        # Input shape: (batch_size, 1, 28, 28)
        self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2)  # Output shape: (batch_size, 32, 28, 28)
        self.pool = torch.nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0)  # Output shape: (batch_size, 32, 14, 14)
        self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2)  # Output shape: (batch_size, 64, 14, 14)
        # After another pooling, we get: (batch_size, 64, 7, 7)
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 1024)  # Fully connected layer
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(1024, 10)  # Output layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)  # Flatten the output for the fully connected layer
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = CNNNet()
model.to(device)
```

This CNN model starts with two convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the output. After the convolutional layers, the data is flattened and passed through two fully connected layers. The final layer outputs 10 classes corresponding to the digits 0-9.

Remember, when training this CNN model, you'll need to ensure your input data (`train_csv` and `test_csv`) is reshaped appropriately to match the expected input shape of the model, which is `(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)`. This might involve converting the flat 784-pixel input vectors into 28x28 2D arrays and adding a channel dimension.
