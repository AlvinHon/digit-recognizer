To save the prediction output into a CSV file with the header "ImageId,Label", you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the predictions.
2. **Append each prediction** along with its corresponding image ID to the list.
3. **Convert the list to a DataFrame** and save it as a CSV file using `pandas`.

Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
import pandas as pd

predictions = []  # Step 1: Initialize an empty list for predictions

for i in range(0, len(test_csv)):
    x = test_csv.iloc[i, :].values.astype(np.float32)  # Features (all columns)
    sample = torch.tensor(x, device=device, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1, 28, 28)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        y_pred = model(sample)
        _, predicted = torch.max(y_pred, 1)
        predictions.append((i+1, predicted.item()))  # Step 2: Append (ImageId, Label)

# Step 3: Convert to DataFrame and save as CSV
df_predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=["ImageId", "Label"])
df_predictions.to_csv('./predictions.csv', index=False)
```

This code snippet does the following:
- Iterates over each row in the test CSV, making predictions as before.
- Appends each prediction to the `predictions` list with the image ID (starting from 1, hence `i+1`).
- After the loop, converts the `predictions` list into a pandas DataFrame with the specified columns.
- Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file named `predictions.csv` without the index column.
