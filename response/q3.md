The error indicates a mismatch in the dimensions between the input tensor `mat1` and the weights `mat2` in the linear layer of your model. This usually happens in the first linear layer where the input tensor needs to match the number of input features expected by the model. Given the error message, it seems your input tensor has a shape of `(1, 783)`, but the model expects `(1, 784)`.

To fix this error, ensure that the input tensor `x` is correctly reshaped or adjusted to match the expected input size of the model. Since the model expects an input size of `784`, you might be missing one element in your input tensor. This can happen if you're working with image data and you've missed one pixel, or if there's an off-by-one error in how you're slicing the data.

Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of your code:

```python
# Assuming the model expects an input shape of (784,), ensure `x` is correctly shaped
x = torch.tensor(train_csv.iloc[i, 1:].values, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 784).to(device)
y = torch.tensor(train_csv.iloc[i, 0], dtype=torch.long).to(device)

optimizer.zero_grad()
y_pred = model(x)
loss_val = loss(y_pred.view(1, 10), y.view(1))
loss_val.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

Make sure that:
- The input tensor `x` is reshaped to `(-1, 784)` to match the expected input size of the model. The `-1` in `.view(-1, 784)` automatically adjusts the number of rows based on the size of the input.
- This adjustment is applied both in the training and testing phases of your code to ensure consistency.

If the error persists, double-check the model's architecture to ensure that the first linear layer (or equivalent) is defined to accept an input size of `784`.
