To modify the "run the model with a sample data" part of your code to correctly reshape the input sample for the CNN and ensure it's on the correct device, follow these steps:

1. **Reshape the sample**: Since the CNN expects input in the shape `(batch_size, channels, height, width)`, you need to reshape the sample to `(1, 1, 28, 28)`.
2. **Move the sample to the correct device**: If you're using a GPU, ensure the sample tensor is moved to the same device as the model.
3. **Use `model.eval()`: Before running inference, it's good practice to set the model to evaluation mode. This turns off behaviors like dropout that are only used during training.

Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
# Ensure the model is in evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Reshape and move the sample to the correct device
sample = torch.tensor(test_csv.iloc[0, :].values, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1, 28, 28)
sample = sample.to(device)  # Assuming 'device' is defined elsewhere, e.g., device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Run the model with the reshaped sample
with torch.no_grad():  # No need to track gradients for inference
    y_pred = model(sample)
    _, predicted = torch.max(y_pred, 1)  # Use dim=1 to get the max per row

print(f'Predicted: {predicted.item()}')
```

Key modifications include:
- **Reshaping the sample** to match the CNN input shape.
- **Using `model.eval()`** to set the model to evaluation mode.
- **Applying `torch.no_grad()`** to avoid tracking gradients during inference, which saves memory and computation.
- **Correcting the dimension in `torch.max`** to operate across the correct axis, reflecting the output shape of the model.
